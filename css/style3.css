    I'm flattered that you're taking the time to read my code.  I reserve copyright in order to cover my bases, but feel free to learn from it.  Reading other peoples code was part of the way that I learned.  The Readability addon (http://www.readability.com/) gives much of the inspiration for the design of my essays.  Since so many people use it to make websites bearable, I figured that I would cut out the middle man.
